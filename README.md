# Introduction
## What is data augmentation?
Data augmentation can be simply described as any method that makes our dataset larger. To create more images for example, we could zoom the in and save a result, we could change the brightness of the image or rotate it. To get bigger sound dataset we could try raise or lower the pitch of the audio sample or slow down/speed up.

  * [Traditional transformations](https://github.com/AgaMiko/data-augmentation/blob/master/README.md#Traditional-transformations) - linear and elastic transformations. Most commonly used.
  * [Advanced transformations](https://github.com/AgaMiko/data-augmentation/blob/master/README.md#Advanced-transformations) - More advanced techniques used rarely, usually for specific purpose.

## Traditional transformations
Traditional transformations are the most common data augmentation methods applied in deep learning. Traditional transformations are mainly defined as affine (linear) and geometric (elastic) transformations. Typical example of linear operations on an image are rotation, shear, reflection, scaling, whereas geometric can include brightness manipulation, contrast change, saturation or hue.
