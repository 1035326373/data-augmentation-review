# Traditional transformations
Traditional transformations are the most common data augmentation methods applied in deep learning. Traditional transformations are mainly defined as affine (linear) and geometric (elastic) transformations. Typical example of linear operations on an image are rotation, shear, reflection, scaling, whereas geometric can include brightness manipulation, contrast change, saturation or hue.
