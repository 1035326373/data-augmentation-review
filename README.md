# Introduction


* [Traditional transformations](https://github.com/AgaMiko/Bird-recognition-review/blob/master/README.md##Traditional-transformations) - linear and elastic transformations. Most commonly used.
* [Advanced transformations](https://github.com/AgaMiko/Bird-recognition-review/blob/master/README.md##Advanced-transformations) - More advanced techniques used rarely, usually for specific purpose.
* [Neural-based transformations](https://github.com/AgaMiko/Bird-recognition-review/blob/master/README.md##Neural-based-transformations)


## Traditional transformations
Traditional transformations are the most common data augmentation methods applied in deep learning. Traditional transformations are mainly defined as affine (linear) and geometric (elastic) transformations. Typical example of linear operations on an image are rotation, shear, reflection, scaling, whereas geometric can include brightness manipulation, contrast change, saturation or hue.
